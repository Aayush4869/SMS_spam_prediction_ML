This project builds an SMS spam prediction model using supervised learning techniques, focusing on Multinomial Naive Bayes due to its effectiveness with text data. The model classifies SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" by leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and various Naive Bayes classifiers. After comparing Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Multinomial Naive Bayes models, Multinomial Naive Bayes was selected for its superior performance in handling word frequency. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and provides scripts for making predictions on new messages.
